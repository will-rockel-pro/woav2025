// Helper to get the current user from session cookie (server-side)
// This is a simplified example. For production, you'd use Firebase Admin SDK
// to verify ID tokens passed in cookies or headers.
// For this project, we'll assume a client-side set auth state is somewhat reflected
// by client-side cookies, but this isn't secure for actual auth decisions.
// A more robust solution would involve Firebase Admin SDK and session cookies.

// Placeholder for a more secure server-side user retrieval
// In a real app with server-side auth logic, you'd verify an ID token.
// For now, this hook relies on client-side auth state, which might not be
// immediately available or secure for critical server-side decisions.
// This is a simplified approach for now.

  // This is a placeholder. In a real app with server-managed sessions,
  // you would verify a session cookie using Firebase Admin SDK.
  // For client-rendered auth state, this server function cannot directly access it
  // without passing a token from client to server.

  // Since we don't have true server-side session management integrated deeply
  // with Firebase Admin SDK for this demo, we cannot reliably get the Firebase User object
  // on the server without the client explicitly sending an ID token.
  // For purely server components fetching public data or checking "is someone logged in at all",
  // this might be less critical, but for "is this user X", it's vital.

  // We will simulate this by trying to get auth().currentUser which might be populated if this code runs
  // in an environment where client-side auth has initialized, but it's not reliable.
  // A proper implementation uses Admin SDK to verify a token.

    // without an explicit session management strategy (e.g., custom session cookies verified by Admin SDK)
    // For the purpose of differentiating "own profile" vs "other's profile" for data fetching,
    // if this returns null, we assume the viewer is not the owner unless other checks are made.
